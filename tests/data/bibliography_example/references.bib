  abstract = {Background and Context. One goal of K-12 computing education is to teach computational concepts that support learners in responsibly and competently using and evaluating digital technologies. However, recent research indicates that students struggle to make use of such concepts in everyday life. Additionally, research shows that people develop powerlessness and resignation about data-driven technologies, leading to passive user roles. This raises the question of how to support students’ empowerment in navigating and shaping the digital world. Objectives. This paper presents a study investigating how understanding concepts of data-driven technologies supports students’ empowerment in everyday life. It involves developing an educational approach to support students in relating learned concepts to everyday experiences, called learning explanatory models. Method. We have developed a Rasch-scaled instrument to measure understanding of data-driven technologies and motivation, intention, and empowered behavior in engaging with them in everyday life. Using this instrument, the study evaluates the explanatory model approach, which specifically supports such relations between concepts learned in computing and students’ everyday experiences.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the explanatory model approach to address challenges in computing education arising from rapid technological developments and paradigm shifts, particularly regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning. Traditional approaches in computing education aim to teach basic concepts derived from the computer science discipline as they are in order to support students’ understanding of these concepts and digital technologies that implement these concepts. This approach is challenged in topics like machine learning, where the ground truth of the inner workings and the behaviors of these technologies is not so clear, making rethinking approaches in computing education necessary. The explanatory model approach suggests that students learn models about computational concepts and digital artifacts that help them understand, explain, and reason about digital technologies. While drawing on the notion of models in science and science education, this approach emphasizes learning and using explanatory models as a focal point in computing classes. Doing so may help students make use of these models as tools and enable them to reflect on and critique different models in various contexts. Additionally, this paper discusses how making explanatory models explicit in research can enrich computing education research and our discourses and describes avenues for researching explanatory models as different perspectives on computational concepts.},

  abstract = {Programming, when practised in an epistemic sense, can be used as a means of gaining insight into areas of personal interest that extend beyond the programming domain itself, e.g. by analysing data or running a simulation.

This paper reports on an eye-tracking study, aimed at identifying different approaches to using worked examples in this context. The study, conducted with 26 participants from K-12 using SMI REDn eye trackers, aims to uncover different types of (heuristic and presumably epistemic) approaches. In this context, we present an approach to clustering and aggregating scan paths through using dynamic time warping. The results show five different clusters with different behaviours: While some participants had several linear reading phases in the worked example, others focused more on parts that were necessary for their individual efforts. This could be an indication of epistemic programming.},
