  abstract = {Programming, when practised in an epistemic sense, can be used as a means of gaining insight into areas of personal interest that extend beyond the programming domain itself, e.g. by analysing data or running a simulation. However, novice programmers need support in conducting such personal epistemic programming projects. This paper reports on an eye-tracking study, aimed at identifying different approaches to using worked examples in this context. The study, conducted with 26 participants from K-12 using SMI REDn eye trackers, aims to uncover different types of (heuristic and presumably epistemic) approaches. In this context, we present an approach to clustering and aggregating scan paths through using dynamic time warping. The results show five different clusters with different behaviours: While some participants had several linear reading phases in the worked example, others focused more on parts that were necessary for their individual efforts. This could be an indication of epistemic programming.},
